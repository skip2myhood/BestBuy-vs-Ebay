# Roadmap

# Ver 0.04
#Translate code into Beautifulsoup or Scrapy for a more efficient experience

# ver 0.05
#Add a 5th column that will automatically compare prices from Bestbuy prices and Ebay prices

# ver 0.07
#Adjust the fuzzywuzzy code, as it's not able to search for comparison properly

# ver 0.08
#adjust the code as there are a lot of empty spaces. May help if we make the fuzzywuzzy code a little bit less sensitive.
